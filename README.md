Building drone delivery API demo project ongoing currently
Drone Delivery Service

The service is pretty much an application for managing delivery of medication items by drones by exposing various endpoints for loading drones with these medications
An in-memory SQL database was used to demonstrate the capabilities of the application by bypassing all issues attributed to database connection disputes.
Docker was used as well to "containerize" the application, enabling the OS-level isolated run of the application to prevent all OS-specific requirement issues
A seemingly significant issue faced was figuring out a practical way of simulating the battery loss procedure of the drone during travel
